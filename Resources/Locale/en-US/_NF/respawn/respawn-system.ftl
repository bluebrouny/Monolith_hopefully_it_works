ghost-respawn-rules-window-rules = Respawning follows a strict New Life Rule:
    No matter which character you decide to return as,
    Forget the last 30 minutes before death.
    Do not seek revenge or act on information related to your death
    or the last 30 minutes. You may remember earlier events,
    but may not return for your previous lifeâ€™s items
    or to the location of your death during an ongoing situation.
    You may not respawn as the same character on an opposing faction.
    Review the rules for more info.
