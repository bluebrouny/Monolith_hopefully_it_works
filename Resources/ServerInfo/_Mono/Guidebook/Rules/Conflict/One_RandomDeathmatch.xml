# Conflict Rule 1
## Avoid random deathmatch (RDM).

Players must have valid in-character reasons to kill or attack another player.

- [color=red][bold]Random, unprovoked attacks or killings (RDM) are not allowed.[/bold][/color]
- Always prioritize [color=yellow]non-lethal conflict[/color] and [color=green]roleplay escalation[/color].
- Combat should arise naturally through roleplay, with proper escalation and meaningful interaction.
- [color=yellow]Non-lethal options[/color] (such as capturing, negotiating, or detaining) are strongly encouraged to foster deeper storylines.

<!-- [italic][color=yellow]Special Note:[/color][/italic]
- Major factions ([color=yellow]Rogue[/color], [color=yellow]TSFMC[/color], and [color=yellow]USSP[/color]) may kill each other without initiation.
- Civilians may attack members of these factions unprovoked, but may not be killed unreasonably in return. Use escalation and proportionality when dealing with civilians. -->

[italic][color=green]Conflict should be meaningful, escalate naturally, and prioritize roleplay over random violence.[/color][/italic]
